==Citations==
  * [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dants/papers/Cheat07Security.pdf Cheat: monopolizing the CPU without superuser privs] - Cool paper about scheduling and h4x
  * [http://people.freebsd.org/~deischen/docs/p95-anderson.pdf Scheduler Activations: Effective Kernel Support for the User-Level Management of Parallelism] - This is the basis for the XOK exokernel's scheduling, although they used a simplified version.

==Relevant ExoPC code==
   * Get the code for the original XOK from [http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/exo/distrib.html]

==Prerequisites==
   * Something to schedule: processes or XOK's same-but-not enviroments.
   * for Preemptive scheduling, one needs a timer device and the ability to set and respond to timing interrupts.
