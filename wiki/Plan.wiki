==Proposed XOmB (the exokernel) Features==
   * securely multiplexes hardware (resource protection), exposing as close to the bare metal as possible
   * when we must do something on the user's behalf, provide mechanism not policy
   * capability-based security
   * tickless scheduling
   * kgdb support

==Proposed PaGanOS (the rest of the OS, that sits on top of XOmB) Features==
   * Integrated package manager that understands multiple versions of LibOSes (for different, workload-specific tradeoffs) and our security scheme
   * principle of least privilege exposed at all levels
   * new crypto-based security capabilites integrated at all levels, kprivd
   * tools for managing composable LibOSes that we want to link a specific/all executables against
   * DTrace suppport: [http://sendreceivereply.wordpress.com/2007/11/08/i-trace-you-trace-what-about-dtrace/ if they can put it in a microkernel without modifying The Kernel], we can too!

==Proposed LibOS Features==
General Categories of LibOSes:
   * Vitual Machine LibOSes
   * Free OS (Linux/{{{*}}}BSD) as a LibOS
   * API Compatability layer (POSIX/LibC/MPI... Wine?)
   * Language environment (Java VM, logo interpreter, etc.)
   * Optimized subsystems (Zero copy network stack, write optimized I/O, etc.)


The list below is a rough compilation of some of the proposed functionality of LibOS extensions.
   * a Xen Hypervisor compatability layer (lets us run Windows + linux right beside 'native' PaGanOS APPs)
   * a VMware 'paravirt_ops' compat layer (same reason as above)
   * MPI libOS (the supercomputing crowd loves MPI and x64, and they should love on exokernels too!)
   * JVM - anything that speeds up java wins the people's hearts (and corporate wallets :)
   * an 'arch/paganos' for linux to run directly on PaGanOS (compare to 'arch/xen')
   * a libDatabase with raw access to disk/cache behavior and paging. Databases are the most common application that break every assumption of OS abstractions.
   * composable LibOSes - customise based on your needs.
