#summary A vague list of steps.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-QA


   * test kgdb serial debugging (and allow kernel to process interrupts after gdb gets a shake)
   * create an environment (process) concept for the exokernel
   * memory management for kernel?
   * execute an ELF64 multiboot module as a user space environment
   * bare bones LibOS
   * init program / basic app. libs
   * Vitual Memory exokernel interface
   * interrupt inferface
   * scheduler interface
   * Filesystem (+ device) libos
   * userspace program loader
   * APIC / multiprocessor support
   * Multiprocessor startup, IPI
   * security scheme
