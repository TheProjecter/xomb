# Introduction #

We need some good Ideas.  Fortunately using D over C will help eliminate some buffer overflow-type issues, but that is just better programming practice, we need better design, too.

# Finding Good Papers #
  * [The list of all papers to win "Best Paper" at a USENIX conference.](http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/best_papers.html)  I'd start here.
  * I (wolfwood) also have the Addison Wesley "Designing Secure Software" book, and some books about securing your system, if anyone wants to look for ideas.
  * There are some good links at the bottom of [Secure By Design on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design)
  * OpenBSD discusses [security](http://www.openbsd.org/security.html) and [crypto](http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html).  actually, just like XOK, if we want to steal a POSIX LibOS, OpenBSD is probably the place to do it from.
  * [Secure By Design from MSDN :)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/09/SecureByDesign/default.aspx)
